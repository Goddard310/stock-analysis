# Green Stocks Analysis
&nbsp;See VBA_Challenge.xlsm

## Overview of Project
Steve's parents would like to invest in companies whose missions align with their own personal ideals.  We're going to try to diversify their portfolio to keep with their priorities but maximize gains.   
### Purpose
Broaden and diversify the portfolio by assessing past performance across a larger group of green companies.  We'd like this to be an interactive database so that the user can define the year and compare performance with just a couple of clicks. <br />

## Analysis and Challenges
A smaller sample size provides challenges and benefits.  
Of course, with a smaller sample, you aren't getting as much data and the trends could be anomolies.  However, the smaller sample allows us to focus on specific stocks and not get overwhelmed with the data.   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Year
- We have defined the data by Volume and Performance by Year
- In 2017, our Green Stocks, sigificantly outperformed the same stocks in 2018
- There was little correlation between the two years <br />

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We struggled with the change of date.  While the input box worked for the top line, we had to resort to expert (TA) analysis to complete the year-to-year assessment.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Year-to-Year performance? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, green stocks are volatile <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a group, the gains outweighed the losses over the 2-year window, and Steve's family should feel comfortable continuing to invest in this space 
- Which stocks should we recommomend? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would suggest diversifying with stable gainers and some high risk, high reward stocks <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENPH, RUN and VSLR
- What are some limitations of this dataset? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only have 2 years of data and that information is dated <br />
- How did the code perform? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we had some issues with year management, the code performed very quickly <br />
